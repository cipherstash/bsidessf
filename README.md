# ðŸŽ¬ Protecting data vs systems: practicality, performance, and problems solved

## Abstract

Is it possible to protect data directly and not just the systems in which it is stored? Encryption covers a range of options. What should you encrypt & how? What are the trade-offs? Can we get record-level protection without unreasonable overhead?

We appreciate you joining us for our talk at [2024 BSidesSF](https://bsidessf.org/). This README contains additional resources, links, and information that you may find helpful as you explore the topics we discussed during our presentation. The presentation slides are available in the root directory of this repository.
